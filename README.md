-----------------------------------------------

This program runs using the Command Line Interface. These instructions are written with a Windows machine in mind, but similar commands will work regardless of operating system. To run the program:

1. Navigate to the directory that the dupuisproj1.py file resides in.
2. Type "python dupuisproj1.py [URL]" without the quotation marks or brackets and with the URL that you want to extract text data from.
3. If text extraction is successful, a file called "websiteData.txt" will appear in the directory that the program is in.
4. To view the text data from the website that your provided URL links to, open the websiteData.txt file.


TROUBLESHOOTING

If there is an error connecting to your provided website, you will receive an error message that is specific to the cause of the error.

If the error is caused by an unstable or non-existent Internet connection, your error message will read "An error occurred, check your Internet connection."
If the error is caused by something that is not Internet connection related (e.g. a misspelled URL), the error message will read "Failed to download data- could not reach desired website."
