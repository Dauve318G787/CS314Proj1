-----------------------------------------------

This program runs using the Command Line Interface. These instructions are written with a Windows machine in mind, but similar commands will work regardless of operating system. To run the program:

1. Navigate to the directory that the dupuisproj1.py file resides in.
2. Type "python dupuisproj3.py [subreddit name] [url from subreddit] " without the quotation marks and brackets to start the program. The url must be a url from the selected subreddit.
3. If text extraction is successful, a file called "websiteData.txt" will appear in the getRawData folder.
4. If COMMENT extraction is successful (this is different from raw data), a file called "websiteData.txt" will appear in the getProcessedData folder.
