-----------------------------------------------

This program runs using the Command Line Interface. These instructions are written with a Windows machine in mind, but similar commands will work regardless of operating system. To run the program:

1. Navigate to the directory that the dupuisproj1.py file resides in.
2. Type "python dupuisproj3.py [subreddit name] [url from subreddit] " without the quotation marks and brackets to start the program. The url must be a url from the selected subreddit.
3. The program will generate two text files: one with raw data, and one with processed comment data. Navigate to the Data folder to find these. The raw data will be in the "raw" folder, and the processed data will be in the "processed" folder.
