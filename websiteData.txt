    Medieval Times Tour
  



    Guys I know we’ve talked about how the finale of the trilogy will be Hard Rock Cafe or something but I feel like that’s too tame. I throw into the mix, USA and Canada world tour, of Medieval Times locations.
  
    Same tourist hot spots as Margaritaville and Rainforest, but oh so more cursed because of the new role playing aspect. Like can you not imagine Ted for one color and Eddy for the other with an epic storyline of them being torn apart but ending up realizing the real gift was the gift of friendship? Also like the food is shit so that would be hilarious imo.
  
    I’ve attached the locations of each Medieval Times on a road trip website. https://www.medievaltimes.com.
